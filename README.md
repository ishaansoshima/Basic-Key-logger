## Project Description

This project implements a basic keylogger using the `pynput` library in Python. The keylogger captures keyboard input and writes it to a file named `keyfile1.txt`.

## Dependencies

- `pynput`

You can install this dependency using pip:

```bash

```
##Usage

Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official website.

Install the required library using pip:
